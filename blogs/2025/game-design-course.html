                <h1><span>~</span> Game design course</h1>
                <p>I have successfully completed the game design course organized by the association "La Plancia Piena"! 🎮🧩</p>
                <p>During these 25 hours of training, under the expert guidance of game designer Pasquale Facchini, I had the opportunity to deepen and expand my skills in the world of game design. I discovered new techniques, tools, and approaches that have given me an even more comprehensive vision of how to create engaging and innovative gaming experiences. </p>
