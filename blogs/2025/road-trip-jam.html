              <h1><span>~</span> Road Trip Jam</h1>
              <p>My friends Tommaso, Lorenzo, and I, under the name Binary Bucket, have joined a game jam! The event, called <strong>Road Trip Jam</strong>, challenges participants to create a game based on the theme of a road trip.</p>  
              <p>For our project, we are developing a narrative adventure game about three siblings going on a journey together. Along the way, players will make choices that shape their relationships and experiences. We wanted to create a game that feels both personal and universally relatable—one that captures the emotions and connections built during a trip.</p>  
              <p>For us, this game isn’t just about the road trip itself; it’s about the memories made along the way. And in creating it, we’ve made a few of our own.</p>  
              <p>The game jam deadline is <strong>April 26</strong>, and we’re excited to bring our vision to life!</p>  
              <p>Check out the jam here: <a style="text-decoration: none !important; color:#52c755" href="https://itch.io/jam/road-trip-game-jam" target="_blank">Road Trip Jam</a>.</p>
